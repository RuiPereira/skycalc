DOC CONTENTS:

skycalcman.html, .pdf, .tex -- 

	These are three versions of skycalcman, the manual
	for the text-based skycalc program.  They're
	all almost the same except for format.
	The algorithms used and expected accuracy
	are discussed fairly comprehensively.
	
guimanual.html --

	This is  an HTML manual for the GUI, which
	includes annotated screenshots.  The
	various ".png" files are the screenshots.

skysub.doc --

	This describes how to use the raw skysub
	routines in python scripts.   You should
	also obviously be able to call these 
	routines from C programs; skysub.h
	is a file of function prototypes.

NOTES:

- The GUI versions have buttons which pop up a help text 
  and a reference manual.  Hopefully these will be adequate 
  for most users.

- None of these manuals is a text on time-and-the-sky -- it
  is assumed that the user is already familiar with
  these topics.
