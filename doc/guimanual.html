<p>
The programs <i>skycalcgui.py</i> and <i>skycalcdisp.py</i> perform
"time-and-the-sky" calculations of interest to astronomers carrying
out nighttime observations.
Both versions use graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which gives them
a look-and-feel similar to web forms.  They are based on the
venerable <i>skycalc</i> program, which has a text-based interface.
(The software distribution also contains the most recent version of the 
text-based program; installation of this is optional).
<p>
The <i>gui</i> and <i>disp</i> versions differ only in that 
the latter has a "planetarium display" option which
plots a map of the visible sky.  This can be enormously helpful.  
but is more difficult to install because its software dependencies.
<p> 
While the graphical user interface should make the program
fairly intuitive, this guide may point out some less obvious
features.  It may also be useful for those who are deciding 
whether or not to install it.
<p>
<a name="technical"><b>Some technical details:</b></a>
<p>
</font>  
The GUI is written in Python and uses Python's Tkinter module.  
You can see if these are available on your system by typing
<pre>
	python
	from Tkinter import *
</pre>
... if there aren't any error messages, you should be fine.
<p>
If they don't come up, you might try installing the STScI-Python
bundle from the 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf">Pyraf</a>,
website.  
Once you have Pyraf running, the rest is easy (except for
the ppgplot stuff described below, which is separate).  While you're
at it, grab numarray (see below).  Nearly all IRAF users will
find Pyraf to be very useful, especially its scripting capabilities.
It will change your life!
<p>
The planetarium display in <i>skycalcdisp.py</i> is built on 
Tim Pearson's 
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/">PGPLOT</a> 
graphics subroutine library, and also on a Python wrapper for 
PGPLOT written by Nick Patavalis, which is called 
<a href="http://efault.net/npat/hacks/ppgplot/">ppgplot</a>. 
The ppgplot wrapper requires that all array arguments be 
the special "array" type used by the
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray">
numarray</a> package.  This package is
available from Space Telescope Science Institute.  Note that 
ppgplot can also be built to use Numeric (the precursor to 
numarray), but the two versions are mutually incompatible.  The
ppgplot and numarray 
packages are useful for <i>many</i> purposes beyond skycalcdisp,
so they may be worth installing in any case.  Again, note that
numarray can easily be installed as part of 
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyraf">Pyraf</a>.
<p>
There is an older, text-based version called <i>skycalc</i> which
offers similar functionality to the GUI-based programs.
It is easy to use and simpler to install, since it requires only 
the C compiler and standard libraries to build.
Although <i>skycalc</i> is easy to learn,
the GUI will be more intuitive to most users.
<p>
See the README file in the source directory for instructions as
to how to install these programs.  A makefile is provided for
the text-based versions, and a setup.py for the python-based
versions.  These should greatly simplify the task of installation.
<p>
One note on the display version -- if the planetarium display fails
with a runtime error about something being "not an array",
this is a symptom that <i>ppgplot</i> is not configured for 
the right numerical python version.
If you have <i>Numeric</i> installed, try changing the line
early in the source code which reads "from numarray import *"
to "from Numeric import *".  This may fix it.

<font size="+1">
<a name="main"><b> The main window </b></a>
<p>
<h1><img src="mainwindow4.png" align="center"></h1>
</center>
This is the <b>main control window</b> for the GUI.  Basically, you enter
input variables in the upper left and choose a site from the site
menu (<a href="#site">see below</a> if your site isn't on the menu).  
Then, whenever 
the output refreshes, a large number of observing circumstances are 
computed and displayed.  Notations around the figure point out some 
possibly non-obvious features. 
<p>
To make the computations go, 
<ul>
<li> Hit a left- or right- arrow key in the main window to step time
backward or forward by the amount given by "timestep"
<li> Type a carriage return anywhere in the main window.  Typing a 
carriage return in the "timestep" entry field also steps the time.
<li> Press any of the following: "Refresh output", "Step time", 
"Set to Now", or "UT - local".
<li> Select a new site from the site menu.
<li> Select a new object from the (optional) object list.
</ul>
<p>
For more information, look through the help text or reference manual,
which pop up if you push their buttons.
If you have questions about the details of the calculations or
their expected accuracy, 
refer to the extensive manual for the (text-based) <i>skycalc</i> program.
The underlying C-language functions used in <i>skycalc</i> are 
largely the same as for 
the GUI versions.  The "doc" directory of the present distribution
contains versions of the <i>skycalc</i> manual in several different formats.
<p>
Most of the <b>buttons</b> in the panel at the bottom of the window spawn
subwindows.  For some (but not all) of these, clicking on their buttons
in the main window will put them in the foreground if they have been
buried by other windows.  The Planetarium, Text Tables,  and 
Object List windows are exceptions to this rule - the planetarium's
button toggles it on and off; the Text Tables and Get object list
buttons spawn new instances of the windows.

<a name="hourly"><b> The Hourly Airmass window </b></a>
<p>
<h1><img src="hawindow.png" align="center"></h1>
</center>
<p>

The <b>Hourly Airmass</b> window tends to be heavily used.
It provides an hour-by-hour report of the most important 
circumstances through the night.  The circumstances are
computed for the celestial location,
geographic site, and date set in the main window.
If the input time in the main window is 
before local noon, the previous night is presented (so if it's
past midnight you still get the current night); if the time
is after noon, the data are for that night.
<p>
The first columns give the time in three forms:
local clock time (daylight savings if it is in effect), UT, 
and sidereal.
Then come the hour angle, airmass, and the altitudes of the moon
(if above the horizon) and the sun (if it is higher than 
18 degrees below the horizon).  The display typically goes from
a little before sunset to a little after sunrise, though this
can vary somewhat.  There are enough lines to cover the longest
nights adequately for latitudes less than about 50 degrees.
<p>
<b><font size="+2" color = "#ff0000">Co</font><font size="+2" color="#ff00ff">lo</font><font size="+2" color="#9411e0">rs</font></b> 
are used to warn the user 
of potentially difficult conditions, as follows:

<ul>
<li> The Hour Angle field turns orange when the hour angle exceeds
6 hours.
<li> The airmass field turns yellow when the airmass is &gt; 
2, orange at &gt; 3, and red at &gt; 4.
<li> The moonalt field (altitude of the moon above the horizon in
degrees) turns blue when the predicted lunar contribution to the
sky brightness 'lunsky' exceeds 21.5 mag per square arcsec in V.  
At a dark site this more-or-less
doubles the sky brightness above the moonless value.  At 19.5 mag 
per square arcsec the field turns 
a lilac-purple color.  
<li> When the object is close to the moon,
another color scheme is used.  At &lt; 10 degrees from 
the moon, the field is always colored red.  When the object is 
between 10 and 25 degrees from the moon, the field is rendered
in yellow, orange, or red, depending on the sky brightness, at the
same 'cut points' used for blue and lilac warnings.  You can 
check out doubtful cases in detail in the main window, by setting 
the time and noting the "lunsky" and "moon-obj ang."
output variables.
<li> The sunalt field is light blue when the sun is up.  During twilight,
a red-orange-yellow system is used, based on how many magnitudes of
twilight there are.  This figure is the predicted clear-sky enhancement
above dark night sky, in the zenith, measured in the blue, and 
given in magnitudes; thus 5.0 magnitudes of twilight means the
sky in the zenith is predicted to be 100 times brighter than a "dark" sky.
When this figure exceeds 8 mag, the field is red; at 4 to 8 magnitudes, 
it is orange; and at &lt; 4 mag, it is yellow.  When there is 
no twilight, the field reverts to grey.  Obviously, the actual
sky brightness depends in a complicated way on atmospheric 
conditions.

<b> The Site Selection Menu </b>
<p>
<a name="site"><h1><img src="sitewindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>
</center>
<p>
Pushing one of the <b>site</b> buttons loads the parameters for the
listed site and refreshes the calculations. 
<p>
<b>If your site is not on the menu</b>, you'll have to enter the 
parameters one-by-one in the main window. <font color="#ff0000"> 
<b>BUT NOTE:</b> </font> before you do
this, you need to select the last choice, <b>Other (allow user entries)</b>.  
If you don't, 
your painstakingly-entered numbers will be WIPED OUT when you
refresh the output!  The reason for this is that under ordinary
circumstances, the program reads the observatory choice from the
site menu and sets the observatory parameters every time a calculation 
is called for (which is the behavior you'd generally want).  Selecting the
<b>Other</b> choice overrides this behavior.
<p>
If you do need to load your own site by hand, note that 
you can enter longitude in degrees east (the almanac
convention) by appending " d e" to the longitude.  The
value will reappear as hours, minutes, and seconds <i>west</i>,
which is the program's internal convention.
<p>
Entering sites by hand gets old real fast, so you may want to
customize the source code to include your favorite site.  Just
look at <i>cooclasses.py</i> and follow the examples given there.
<p>
<a href="#contents">[Back to contents.]</a><p>

<font size="+1">
<b> The Object Menu </b>
<p>
<a name="objects"><h1><img src="objectwindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>
</center>
<p>
If you push <b>Get object list</b> in the main window,
a file-selection dialog box appears, and once you've
selected a properly-formatted object list file, a window
similar to the one above appears.  The expected object file 
format is one object per line, given as 
<pre>
name     rah  ram  ras    decd  decm  decs   equinox
</pre>
or for example,
<pre>
4U2129+47   21 29 36.2   47 04 08  1950.
</pre>
You can't have any blank space in the name, and you 
need three numbers for each coordinate separated by
blank space. All the information has to be there (no
defaults).  Otherwise the format is free -- the 
numbers can be in any column.  If you have a negative
dec, the minus sign must be flush with the degrees,
as in
<pre>
PiStar   3 14 15.9   -0 03 14  2000
</pre>
(-0 evaluates correctly as a negative number).
<p>
Once you've loaded a list, <i>double-clicking</i> a selection
in this box loads its coordinates in the program and
refreshes all the output.  You can also load an object
by typing its name into the "objname" field in the 
main window and hitting carriage return.
It is easy to check a list of targets for
observability by running through the list while 
looking at the Hourly Airmass window.
The object list figures in several <a href = "#scenarios">use scenarios
</a> described later. 
<p>
Using the buttons provided, you can sort the list in
various obvious ways.  <b>List by proximity</b> is the least
obvious -- this sorts in order
of proximity to the currently-set coordinates.  The
<b> dismiss list</b> button removes the objects from the 
list and destroys the window.  You can have multiple
lists open at the same time -- each press of the 
<b>Get object list</b> button on the main window 
creates a new list window.  Dismissing a list removes
only the objects associated with that list.  If you
load a new list which has an object that is already
loaded (i.e., you create a name collision), the object
is loaded with "|" appended and prepended to the name, for
example <tt>vega</tt> would become <tt>|vega|</tt>.

<a href="#contents">[Back to contents.]</a><p>

<font size="+1">
<b>Text Tables</b>
<p>
<a name="texttasks"><h1><img src="textwindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>
</center>
<p>
This window does computations that produce tables of data. 
It holds up to 500 lines of output.  The object and site coordinates are
taken from the main window; additional input parameters are set with the
input boxes provided.  There are three different calculations available:
<ul>
<li> <b>Seasonal Observability</b> (shown above): 
This option prints a table summarizing 
the observability of the object at each new and full moon between the 
start date and end date.  Each line gives the hour angle and airmass
of the object at the start, middle, and end of the night (the start and
end are defined by 18-degree twilight).  After that, three columns give
the number of nighttime hours the object spends at less than 3, less
than 2, and less than 1.5 airmasses.
<li> <b>Compute Times</b> is one of two options that relate to 
periodic phenomena outside the solar system, such as eclipses of 
binary stars.  In the boxes provided, enter the barycentric (basically
heliocentric) ephemeris of the object -- don't neglect the 
uncertainties (the sigmas) of the zero point and the period!
The "compute times" button lists predicted eclipse times and their
uncertainties, both in time and phase.  The predicted times are
<i>geocentric</i> -- they are the times the signals are predicted
to arrive at earth.  Times are either local or UT, depending on the
setting in the main window.
<li> <b>Compute phases</b> is similar, but rather than listing
predicted times when the phase is zero, it prints the predicted
phase at repeating times.  The interval between the tabulated
times is the <i>time step</i>.
</ul>
<p>
The <i>max sunalt</i> and <i>max airmass</i> numbers are used
to filter the output from "Compute Times" and "Compute phases"
calculations, for example to those events visible during darkness
from your site.  At the end of twilight, the altitude of the sun
is -18 (the units are degrees).  To turn off filtering, set the
max sunalt to +90 and the max airmass to -1.
<p>
The <b>Erase output</b> button clears the output window, and the 
<b>Dump output</b> button writes the contents of the window to a
text file "skycalc.out".     
<p>
The text tool used in the window is actually a primitive text editor.
If you like, you can annotate your output before you write it 
to a file.

<font size="+1">
<b> The Nightly Almanac </b>
<p>
<a name="nightly"><h1><img src="almanacwindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>
</center>
<p>

The <b>Nightly Almanac</b> window lists the times 
of various phenomena through the night.  If the input
time from the main window is before noon, the 
previous night is listed.
<p>
Rise and set times are adjusted
for the depression of the horizon using the "elevhoriz"
site parameter from the main window.  Refraction is
taken into account and the rise- and set time refers 
to the upper limb of the object.  Actual times
will vary by around a minute because of refraction,
and much more in sites with irregular horizons. 
<p>
Moonrise and moonset are listed in the order they
occur.  One or the other may not be listed if it occurs 
around mid-day.  You can expect bizarre behavior for 
sites at very high latitudes.
<p>
<a href="#contents">[Back to contents.]</a><p>
<center>
<font size="+1">
<b> Alternate Coordinates</b>
<p>
<a name="altcoo"><h1><img src="coordwindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>
</center>
<p>
Several rather arcane items appear on the 
<b>Alternate Coordinates</b> window.  At the
top are the coordinates at the date specified in
the main window, corrected for precession and 
proper motion (if any).  

There are a few <b>input variables</b> in this
window - they're here since most people won't
need to use them much.  They are:
<ul>
<li> The <b>proper motion</b>
<li> A <b>radiobutton</b> controlling the interpretation of
the two numbers in the proper motion field; and 
<li> The <b>epoch</b> (not equinox!) of the input 
coordinates.
<li> The <b>Galactic latitude and longitude.</b>  
These are generally output variables, but entering
a value and hitting a carriage return forces the 
RA and dec in the main window to agree with the 
Galactic coordinates.  The behavior is analogous
to that of the "jd" field in the main window -- 
mostly output, but can be used as input with
a carriage return.  (This feature is not 
implemented for the ecliptic coordinates.)
</ul>
<p>
The two components of
proper motion can be entered on the indicated
line, and the radiobuttons control how the 
proper motion will be interpreted (more below). 
The units of proper motion are <font color="ff0000"> 
milliarcsec per year </font> (not
arcsec!) for the magnitude, and degrees for the 
position angle (in the third choice). 
<p>
If the first radiobutton is checked, the first number
in the PM pair is interpreted as the number of 
milliarcsec per year 
the object would move east on an image; if the 
second button is pushed, the first number is 
how many milliarcsec per year the right 
ascension increases.  These are the same 
at the equator, but away from the equator, the 
second option requires a larger number to
describe the same easterly motion.  Note that
the second convention is used by the UCAC2.
If the third radiobutton is checked, the proper
motion pair is interpreted as a magnitude in
milliarcsec per year and 
a position angle in degrees (0 = moving due north, 
90 = due east, and so on).
<p>
The "epoch" line requires careful explanation,
since the distinction between <i>epoch</i> and 
<i>equinox</i> is often not understood.  
<ul>
<li> The <i>equinox</i> of a set of coordinates
refers to the date of the coordinate system, 
that is, the date at which the precession 
lines up with the coordinates which are quoted.
In recent catalogs, this almost always 2000.
<li> The <i>epoch</i> of coordinates only matters
if there is proper motion.  It refers
to the date at which the moving object was at the 
position you're quoting.  Thus if
you determine a position on a 1954 Sky Survey
plate, but refer it to J2000 coordinates, it is
epoch 1954, but equinox 2000.
</ul>
<p>
The <i>epoch</i> field here is the epoch of the
position quoted in the main window, and only 
makes a difference if there is a non-zero 
proper motion.
(The <i>equinox</i>
of the input coordinates is set in the main 
window).  
<p>
Note that the 
coordinates listed just below the epoch are for
the coordinates at the time of the input 
date specified in the main window, 
but are referred to the input equinox -- 
that is, they are corrected for proper motion 
<i>only</i>, but not precessed. 
<p>
Ecliptic and galactic coordinates are given toward
the bottom.  The galactic coordinates accurately
conform to the IAU definition.
<p>
Since the figure was prepared, one more output
variable has been added - the <i>parallax
factors</i>, which are the parallax displacements
in RA and dec for a star at unit distance, that
is, the displacements in arcsec for a star at 
1 pc - there are no stars that close, of course.
<p>
One note: The precession constants used are
the ones recommended by the IAU in 1976.  The IAU
has since recommended improved precession algorithms.
These are not yet implemented here, but for most
optical-astronomy purposes the differences will
not be a concern.

<b> Planets</b>
<p>
<a name="planets"><h1><img src="planetwindow.png" align="center"></h1></a>

<p>
The <b>planets window</b>
gives low-precision coordinates of the planets,
and their hour angle at the date and time specified
in the main window.
The last column gives the separation in the sky
between the input coordinates and the planet.  When 
this dips below 1 degree for any planet,
the line for that planet turns orange.  An orange
warning appears in the lower right of the main
window, too, together with the name of the possibly
troublesome planet(s).

I've saved the best for last!
<p>
If you can get ppgplot going, you can run  
<i>skycaldisp.py</i>, which is identical to 
<i>skycalgui.py</i> except for the addition of this
<b>planetarium display</b>.  
<p>
Some features:
<ul>
<li> The zenith is at the center of the plot.  The magnification
of the projection increases away from the zenith.  Shapes are preserved
locally, so constellations are recognizable.
<li> The red dashed circles indicate 2, 3, and 4 airmasses.  The
solid partial circle around the outside shows the horizon.
Objects below the horizon are still plotted.  The display is cut
off at the far north and south in order to give adequate scale 
elsewhere.
<li> The meridian and lines at 2-hour intervals of hour angle
are shown, out to +-6 hours, and the celestial equator is drawn
in.
<li> Stars to 4th magnitude are shown sized according to brightness.
They are rendered in white.
<li> Solar system objects are rendered in yellow.  The moon is
drawn in with the correct phase and orientation.  Its size is 
exaggerated.  The sun is drawn with a sun symbol.  Planets through 
Saturn are shown sized by magnitude, and the outer planets are 
omitted.
<li> A blue box indicates the location of the coordinates from 
the main window.
<li> If an <i>object list</i> is selected, all the object names are plotted
on the display in green (and the names disappear on
refresh after an object list is unloaded).
In this version, the display isn't automatically refreshed 
when a list is loaded, but it is refreshed as soon
as you do anything.  The object's actual location is in the
middle of its name, at the bottom. 
</ul>
<p>
One useful strategy is to jump the time forward (or back) 
by typing the left and right arrow keys in the main window.
By varying the timestep, one can visualize hourly
and daily circumstances (e.g, watching the moon move night by
night through the various targets one has loaded).
<p>
As noted earlier, this display requires that ppgplot be 
loaded, which in turn requires installation of PGPLOT and its 
C-bindings.  This takes some doing, but is not particularly 
difficult on recent Linux systems.  See the README included with
the software distribution for some hints on environment variables
which may be needed to run ppgplot. I've run into difficulties
on Mac OS-X, probably because I'm unfamiliar with the architecture.
I'd welcome details of successful Mac OS-X ports.

<a name="scenarios"><b>Skycalcgui in action: Some Scenarios. </b></a>
</font>
</center>
<p>
When a program gets this complicated, it can be helpful to 
illustrate its use in some common situations.  
<p>
<b>I'm applying for observing time at Tololo.  What should
I put for "Range of Acceptable Dates"?  Also, I need dark sky;  
how far from new moon I can stand? </b>  
<ul>
<li> Select 'Cerro Tololo' in the <a href = "#site">Site Parameters</a>
menu, then press 'Hide' to save screen space.
<li> If you have more than just a couple of targets, edit their
coordinates into a list as described in the 
<a href = "#objects">Object Lists</a> section.  Otherwise just
type the main target's coordinates into the input variables.
<li> Once you have your target loaded, pop open a "Text Tables"
window, and run the "Seasonal Observability" for the semester's
start and end dates.  You can quickly see which dark runs will
give you adequate time on your target.  
<li> Once you've settled on a few dark runs, set the date and
time to midnight during one of your chosen dark runs. 
Set the timestep to 1 day.  Look at the 
<a href "#hourly"> Hourly Airmass</a> window, and use
the left- and right-arrow keys (typed into the main window)
to step the time back and forth through the dark runs.  
Watch the moonalt column in the Hourly Airmass display.  
When it turns blue, the moonlight is predicted to roughly 
double the sky brightness.  See the lunsky item in the main 
window for actual values.  
<li> Repeat as needed for all your high-priority targets.
</ul>
<p>
After a little playing around, you'll have a good idea of the 
range of dates, and how far from new moon you can accept.
Of course, the lunar sky brightness values are not firm
predictions -- haze, thin cloud, volcanic aerosols, or whatever 
can greatly increase the sky brightness.   
<p>
<b>It's getting near twilight; I'm in the middle of an exposure 
and realize that I'd like to grab a short exposure of another target,
but twilight and airmass may be a problem. 
I can be on target in about 25 minutes.  What will the 
situation be then? </b>  
<ul>
<li> Enter the next object's coordinates.  If it's on a target
list you've loaded you can just double-click it.
<li> Hit "set to now".
<li> Enter "25 m" in the timestep.  Advance the time by 
hitting a carriage return or a right arrow.
<li> Examine the output variables in the main window -- 
the airmass and 'ztwilight' especially -- and see if there's 
anything untoward. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>I'm going observing next week.  I have a lot of potential
targets, and am wondering which ones I might be able to get.</b>
<ul>
<li> Make a list of targets as described in the
<a href = "#objects">Object Lists</a> section.  
<li> Select a date during your run.  
<li> Set the timestep to "1 d".
<li> Step through your list, double-clicking to select targets,
while watching the <a href = "#hourly">Hourly Airmass window</a>.
<li> For each target, step the date back and forth with the 
left and right arrow keys while watching the Hourly Airmass
window.  The moonalt column will warn you if the moon might be 
a particular problem for this target on any given night.
<li> You might want to keep an eye on the "planet_proxim"
warning box in the main window, to avoid unpleasant surprises.
</ul>
<p>
If you have the <a href = "#display">planetarium display</a>
these scenarios can all be made more vivid and intuitive.  This
takes up a lot of screen real estate and requires a fast machine
(e.g. recent PC) to redraw the display with acceptable speed. 
Note that the planetarium display toggles on and
off when you press its button on the main window.
<p>
Here is a scenario in which the planetarium display is
especially helpful:
<p>
<b> I have two dozen targets of varying difficulty and 
importance, a waxing moon, and only one night of observing time 
left.  I won't be able to get to all of them.  How can I 
visualize the situation through the night and decide which 
ones to go for? </b>
<ul>
<li> Load up an <a href = "#objects">object list</a>.
<li> Pop up the <a href = "#display">planetarium display</a>.
<li> Set the timestep to "1 h" and the date to tonight ('set to 
now' will do this if it's past noon).
<li> Watch the display.  Keeping the mouse in the main control
window, type left and right arrows to step back and forth through the night.
<li> If you need more specific information on a particular 
object, double-click it on the object list and examine the 
hourly airmass and main windows.
<li> Make the hard scientific choices about which objects to observe.
The program can't help you here, but it can
keep your choices within the realm of feasibility.
